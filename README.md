Exploring the Orbit of Mercury Classically and Relativistically

This was a research project I did in high school. The accurate prediction of Mercury's Orbit is a famous example of the merits of Eistein's Theory of Relativity. As such the goal of the project was to qualitatively explore the differences in orbital trajectories predicted by Classical Mechanics vs. General Relativity using Mercury. I solved the Classical Two-Body Problem using Lagrangian Mechanics and used numerical methods to solve the DEs in Matlab to simulate the orbit. Similarly, the relativistic prediction for the orbit was found using the Schwarzschild Solution to Einstein's Field Equations. From the Schwarzschild Metric, I derived the set of DEs needed and numerically solved them and plotted the solutions in Matlab. Comparing the results, the apsidal precession in Mercury's Orbit was found in the GR solution as predicted.
